# States

In the input file, an automaton is defined. Find all pairs of equivalent states $(q_i, q_j)$, where $i < j$, and write them to the output file in lexicographically ordered pairs. A state pair is recorded as two numbers separated by a space, also in lexicographical order. All pairs are written in a single line. If there are no equivalent states, write $-1$ to the file.
