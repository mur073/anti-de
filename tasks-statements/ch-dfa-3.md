# Superposition

In the input file, two automata are defined. Construct an automaton that is their superposition: $a_1, ..., a_n –> A –> b_1, ..., b_n -> B -> c_1, ..., c_n$. To encode the states of the resulting automaton, use variables encoding the states of automaton $A$ first, then variables encoding the states of automaton $B$.
