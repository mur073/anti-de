# 4. Preserving 3

In the input file, the function is defined by a vector of its values. Find all partitions that it preserves. Write each partition to the output file as a separate line. Equivalent elements should be without spaces, and spaces should separate non-equivalent elements. Inside each line, substrings corresponding to equivalence classes should be ordered lexicographically. For example, the partition $\{\{0,1\}, \{2, 3, 4\}\}$ in $P_5$ is defined as following:\
**01 234**

The lines corresponding to the partitions are also ordered lexicographically. Do not print the number of partitions.
