In the input file, a function of 3 variables is defined by a vector of its values. Find all 2-ary functions that it generates using operations of composition, variable renaming, and addition/removal of irrelevant variables (selector functions are generated by any function by definition). Write each function in a separate line in the output file, ordering the lines lexicographically. Do not print the number of functions.
