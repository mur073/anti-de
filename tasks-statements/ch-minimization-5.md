# Tautological DNFs

In the input file, a minimized DNF (Disjunctive Normal Form) is given. Find all tautological DNFs. In the output file, each tautological DNF should be represented by lines corresponding to ECs, ordered lexicographically. The tautological DNFs themselves should also be ordered lexicographically (assuming that the entire DNF is written in a single line). Do not print the number of prime implicants.
