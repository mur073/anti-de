In the input file, a function of $2$-variables is defined by a vector of its values. Find all unary functions that it generates using operations of superposition, variable renaming, and addition/removal of irrelevant variables (selector functions are generated by any function by definition). Write each function to the output file as a separate line, after sorting the lines lexicographically. Do not print the number of functions.
